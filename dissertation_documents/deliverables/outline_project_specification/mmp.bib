Character Recognition (OCR) Engine under Apache License 2.0 for recognition of
handwriting samples of lower case Roman script. Handwritten isolated and
free-flow text samples were collected from multiple users. Tesseract is trained
to recognize user-specific handwriting samples of both the categories of
document pages. On a single user model, the system is trained with 1844
isolated handwritten characters and the performance is tested on 1133
characters, taken form the test set. The overall character-level accuracy of
the system is observed as 83.5\%. The system fails to segment 5.56\% characters
and erroneously classifies 10.94\% characters.}},

    This thesis was a great reference material for handwriting recognition. The used the Tesseract OCR engine to analyse human handwriting  and convert the code written on the paper to the actual output. The most interesting part of this thesis, for me, was when the author described the training process for handwriting reconition, which I will look to follow a similar approach.}

    abstract = {{The development and implementation of an algorithm for automated text string separation that is relatively independent of changes in text font style and size and of string orientation are described. It is intended for use in an automated system for document analysis. The principal parts of the algorithm are the generation of connected components and the application of the Hough transform in order to group components into logical character strings that can then be separated from the graphics. The algorithm outputs two images, one containing text strings and the other graphics. These images can then be processed by suitable character recognition and graphics recognition systems. The performance of the algorithm, both in terms of its effectiveness and computational efficiency, was evaluated using several test images and showed superior performance compared to other techniques.}},
